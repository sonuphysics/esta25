>**EStA : Electronic Structure Automater** 



`Electronic Structure Automater` ([EStA](home-page)) aka pytware for analyzing and calculating to some extent the properties 
of materials and molecules.

1. EStA software package is capable of analyzing, pre-processing, and post-processing data from different software packages such as `vasp`, `quantum-espresso`, `gaussian`, `xTB`,  `Orca`, grrm, and so on. 

3. It can automatically generate input files for vasp, quantum-esspresso, gaussian, grrm, and other 
codes as well can do some model calculations. It is written in `python3`, `modern Fotran`, and some 
part in `C`. In future, it will be able to perform calculations for predicting electronic and transport properties.


## Table Of Contents
