![EStA](./image/logo.jpg)
 

`Electronic Structure Automater` ([EStA](home-page)) aka pytware for analyzing and calculating to some extent the properties 
of materials and molecules.

1. EStA software package is capable of analyzing, pre-processing, and post-processing data from different software packages such as `vasp`, `quantum-espresso`, `gaussian`, `xTB`,  `Orca`,  and so on. 

3. It can automatically generate input files for vasp, quantum-esspresso, gaussian, grrm, and other 
codes as well can do some model calculations. It is written in `python3`, `modern Fotran`, and some 
part in `C`. In future, it will be able to perform calculations for predicting electronic and transport properties.



**Features**
-    automatic input generations for different electronic structure softwares
-    output analysis of different file formats such xml, yaml, json, and so on
-    vibrational and thermodynamical analysis of atomic and molecular systems
-    transition state finding using CI-NEB approach (interfaced with quantum-espresso for the time being!!)
-    zone centre phonon calculations based on gradient input as implemented in phonon directory (to be expanded to whole zone)
-    model calculations of lattice thermal conductivity (first principles calculation is experimental)
-    tight binding calculation of bulk materials
-    point group detection (space group detection and other stuff carried out using spglib)
-    lattice transformation analysis   
-    machine learning prediction of *important* physical property (more to add soon!!)
-    easy to use unit conversion  routine; axsf, bxsf, cube files .. for visualizations etc
-    reading force constants from phonopy calculations at gamma or any other q-point and finding the force-constants ( :math:`\phi_{i,j})` between all pair of atoms or specific atom pairs along with respective distances; further exploration of stretching and bending force constants (:math:`\phi_{stretch}` and :math:`\phi_{bend}`)
-    Infra-red and Raman-intensity calculations for periodic systems (automatically generates the needed files to compute the :math:`\epsilon_{\infty}`)
-    Manipulation of atomic and crystal structures such as atomic substitution, deletion, extension, modulation, and inversion, etc.
-    more routines (interfacing of xTB with grrm, minimization procedures, fortran code for calculating static dielectric constant, mode oscillator strength etc..)  are there, but to be added to esta package!!!
