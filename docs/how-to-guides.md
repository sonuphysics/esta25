This part of the project documentation focuses on a **problem-oriented** approach.
Based on the documentation for EStA v3, here are concrete guide ideas & how you might structure them, with relevant modules
---
<!-- - Modules in EStA -->
<!-- `cf` is converion factor module which can handle conversion of units of measurement from one system 
to another. It is used in the following way: -->



- How to install EStA and set up environment  [click here](https://sonuphysics.github.io/esta3/explanation)
      - `Install via pip / conda / from source `
      - `Installing dependencies (ase, spglib, Fortran parts, C parts, etc.)  `
      - `Verifying the installation works by using tutorials`

---
- How to generate input files for a calculation (VASP / Quantum‑ESPRESSO / Gaussian, etc.)  [click here](https://sonuphysics.github.io/esta3/tutorials/)
     - `Using esta.qeBag.gen_qeinput or gen_qeinput2 etc. `
     - `Setup of input parameters (k‑points, pseudopotentials, etc.) `
---


- How to read and analyze outputs from those softwares 
    - Extracting bands, k‑points, band gaps via esta.qeBag.bands_kpts_band_gap etc. 
    - Reading force constants etc. via phonon subpackage 

---
- How to perform phonon / vibrational / thermodynamic analysis 
    - Using esta.phonon modules to get frequencies, force constants, zero point energy, etc.  
---


- How to find transition states / NEB paths 
    - Using esta.transitionState.neb, optimizer etc. 

---
- How to manipulate / modify structures 
    - E.g. deleting atoms, substitution, cell transformations, vacuum region etc. via esta.general submodules  
---

- How to use machine learning parts 
    - Regression or classification tasks using esta.mlBag etc. if available. Create a UML example: train on data, predict properties.  

---
- Working example from start to finish
    - Pick a physical system (maybe a small molecule or simple crystal), perform structuring, run calculation, extract bands, compute phonons, etc. That will tie many features together for a demo.
