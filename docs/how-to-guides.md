## Modules in EStA

<!-- `cf` is converion factor module which can handle conversion of units of measurement from one system 
to another. It is used in the following way: -->

Based on the documentation for EStA v2.9.5, here are concrete guide ideas & how you might structure them, with relevant modules

<!-- You have two numbers and you need to add them together.
You're in luck! The `calculator` package can help you
get this done.

Download the code from this GitHub repository and place
the `calculator/` folder in the same directory as your
Python script:

    your_project/
    │
    ├── calculator/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── calculations.py
    │
    └── your_script.py

Inside of `your_script.py` you can now import the
`add()` function from the `calculator.calculations`
module:

    # your_script.py
    from calculator.calculations import add

After you've imported the function, you can use it
to add any two numbers that you need to add:

    # your_script.py
    from calculator.calculations import add

    print(add(20, 22))  # OUTPUT: 42.0

You're now able to add any two numbers, and you'll
always get a `float` as a result. -->


# How to install EStA and set up environment
  • Install via pip / conda / from source
  • Installing dependencies (spglib, Fortran parts, C parts, etc.)
  • Verifying the installation works

# How to generate input files for a calculation (VASP / Quantum‑ESPRESSO / Gaussian, etc.)
  • Using esta.qeBag.gen_qeinput or gen_qeinput2 etc. 

  • Setup of input parameters (k‑points, pseudopotentials, etc.)

# How to read and analyze outputs from those softwares
  • Extracting bands, k‑points, band gaps via esta.qeBag.bands_kpts_band_gap etc. 


  • Reading force constants etc. via phonon subpackage 


# How to perform phonon / vibrational / thermodynamic analysis
  • Using esta.phonon modules to get frequencies, force constants, zero point energy, etc. 


# How to find transition states / NEB paths
  • Using esta.transitionState.neb, optimizer etc. 


# How to manipulate / modify structures
  • E.g. deleting atoms, substitution, cell transformations, vacuum region etc. via esta.general submodules 


# How to use machine learning parts
  • Regression or classification tasks using esta.mlBag etc. if available. Create a UML example: train on data, predict properties. 


# Working example from start to finish
Pick a physical system (maybe a small molecule or simple crystal), perform structuring, run calculation, extract bands, compute phonons, etc. That will tie many features together for a demo.
